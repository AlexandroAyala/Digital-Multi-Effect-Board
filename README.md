This is a work in progress senior project for the College of Electrical/Electronic and Computer Engineering Department at CSU Chico.

The Digital Multi-Effect Board is intended to serve as a jack of all trades effect board for musicians on a budget or beginner musicians who have yet to acquire their unique audio profile and the distinct taste for specific audio manufacturers that comes with it. That isn’t to say professionals won’t be able to rock out on the board. The ability to plug any instrument of your choosing and customize the effects on each footswitch allow for a tailor-made experience for every user. The ability to dial in the parameters for each effect allow for extra customizability and the built-in tuner allows for a quicker and more seamless set up. The board has the option to connect to speakers, headphones or an amplifier combo for listening.
